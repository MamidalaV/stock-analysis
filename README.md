## Results:

### Analysis of all other for years 2017 - 2018.

  - At first, the output sheet is formatted by adding a Sheet header and row headers. This is done by using the below code:
    ```
        'Sheet Header
        Cells(1, 1) = "All Stocks (" + yearvalue + ")"
        
        'Create a header row
        Cells(3, 1) = "Ticker"
        Cells(3, 2) = "Total Daily Volume"
        Cells(3, 3) = "Return"
    ```
    - An array has been initialized for all 12 tickers in the worksheet and values has been assigned.
    ```
        'assigning values to elemnets in array
        tickers(0) = "AY"
        tickers(1) = "CSIQ"
        tickers(2) = "DQ"
        tickers(3) = "ENPH"
        tickers(4) = "FSLR"
        tickers(5) = "HASI"
        tickers(6) = "JKS"
        tickers(7) = "RUN"
        tickers(8) = "SEDG"
        tickers(9) = "SPWR"
        tickers(10) = "TERP"
        tickers(11) = "VSLR"
    ```
    - Using multiple 'For' loops and If-then statements, the array is used to loop through all rows in the worksheet to aggregate volume, starting price and ending price of each ticker.
    ```
    For i = 0 To 11
        ticker = tickers(i)
        totalVolume = 0
        
    'Loop through rows in the data.
        Worksheets(yearvalue).Activate
        For j = 2 To rowcount
    
        'a.Find the total volume for the current ticker.
        If Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
            
            totalVolume = totalVolume + Cells(j, 8).Value
        
        End If
        
        'b.Find the starting price for the current ticker.
        If Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker And Cells(j - 1, 1).Value <> ticker Then
            
            startingprice = Cells(j, 6).Value
        
        End If
        
        'c.Find the ending price for the current ticker.
        If Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker And Cells(j + 1, 1).Value <> ticker Then
            
            endingprice = Cells(j, 6).Value
        
        End If
        
     Next j
    ```
    - The output data is inserted on the output sheet using the below lines of code and the 'For' loop is then closed.
    ```
    Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
        Cells(4 + i, 1).Value = ticker
        Cells(4 + i, 2).Value = totalVolume
        Cells(4 + i, 3).Value = ((endingprice - startingprice) / startingprice)

        Next i
    ```
    - The output table is formatted using the below lines of code
    ```
    Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
    Range("A3:C3").Font.Bold = True
    Range("A3:C3").Font.FontStyle = "Bold Italic"
    Range("A3:C3").Borders(xlEdgeBottom).LineStyle = xlContinuous

    Range("B4:B15").NumberFormat = "#,#"
    Range("C4:C15").NumberFormat = "0.0%"
    Columns("A:C").AutoFit

    dataRowStart = 4
    dataRowEnd = 15

    For i = dataRowStart To dataRowEnd

    If Cells(i, 3) > 0 Then
    
        Cells(i, 3).Interior.Color = vbGreen
    
    
    ElseIf Cells(i, 3) < 0 Then
        Cells(i, 3).Interior.Color = vbRed
        
    
    Else: Cells(i, 3).Interior.Color = xlNone
    
    End If

    Next i
```
